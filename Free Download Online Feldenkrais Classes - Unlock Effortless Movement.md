## What is the Feldenkrais Method?

The Feldenkrais Method is a powerful approach to learning and movement that helps you discover new and more efficient ways to move. It's not just about stretching or strengthening; it's about retraining your nervous system to break free from habitual patterns of movement that may be causing pain, discomfort, or limitations.

Developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, the method emphasizes gentle, mindful movement explorations that increase your awareness of how you move. This increased awareness allows you to identify and release unnecessary tension, improve coordination, and discover new possibilities for moving with greater ease and comfort.
