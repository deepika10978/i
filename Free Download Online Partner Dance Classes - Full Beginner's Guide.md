## Essential Equipment and Preparation for Online Classes

Fortunately, you don't need much to get started with online partner dance classes:

*   **A Smooth, Open Space:** Clear a space in your home free of obstacles. A hard floor is preferable for ease of movement.
*   **Comfortable Shoes:** Avoid shoes with too much grip, as you'll need to be able to slide and pivot. Socks can work in a pinch!
*   **Reliable Internet Connection:** A stable connection is crucial for uninterrupted classes.
*   **A Partner (Optional):** While it's called "partner" dance, many online courses offer individual lessons or modify steps for solo practice. Don't let a lack of partner stop you. You can practice the steps on your own!
*   **A Mirror (Recommended):** A mirror can help you check your posture and alignment.
*   **Water Bottle:** Stay hydrated!

*   **Clear and Concise Instruction:** The instructor should be able to break down complex steps into manageable chunks.
*   **Multiple Camera Angles:** Different angles help you see footwork and body positioning clearly.
*   **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** The course should progress logically from basic steps to more advanced combinations.
*   **Drills and Practice Exercises:** Repetition is key to mastering any dance.
*   **Community Support:** Look for courses with a forum or online community where you can ask questions and connect with other students.
