## Understanding Cookies in Web Automation

Cookies are small text files that websites store on a user's computer to remember information about them, such as login details, preferences, and shopping cart items. In web automation with Playwright, setting and managing cookies is crucial for several reasons:

*   **Reproducing Bugs:** Cookies can sometimes contribute to bugs. By setting specific cookie values, you might be able to reproduce a bug that a user has reported.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures (Use with Caution):** While not always recommended, in certain testing environments, you might need to manipulate cookies to bypass security measures for testing purposes. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions.
