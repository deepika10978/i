It's crucial to carefully review the official PMI PGMP Handbook for the most up-to-date and detailed eligibility requirements. Donâ€™t hesitate to check if you qualify!

## Understanding the PGMP Exam

The PGMP exam is a challenging but fair assessment of your program management knowledge and skills.

The exam covers the five performance domains outlined in the PMI's Program Management Standard:

1.  **Strategic Program Management:** Aligning the program with the organization's strategic goals and objectives.
2.  **Program Governance:** Establishing and maintaining the program's governance framework.
3.  **Program Performance:** Monitoring and controlling the program's progress and performance.
4.  **Program Stakeholder Engagement:** Engaging and managing stakeholders throughout the program lifecycle.
5.  **Program Benefits Management:** Identifying, defining, and realizing the program's benefits.

The exam also assesses your understanding of various program management concepts, techniques, and tools. Successful candidates demonstrate their ability to apply these concepts to real-world program management scenarios.
