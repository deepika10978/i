## Understanding the Test Pyramid

The test pyramid, championed by Mike Cohn, provides a visual representation of how much testing effort should be focused on different levels. It emphasizes automating more tests at lower levels (unit and integration tests) and fewer at higher levels (end-to-end tests). This approach maximizes efficiency and reduces feedback cycles.

This free course will cover everything you need to know:

*   **Unit Tests:** Writing fast, reliable unit tests for individual components.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verifying interactions between different parts of your system.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Simulating user flows to ensure the application works as a whole.
*   **The Anti-Patterns:** Learn to avoid the Ice Cream Cone and Cupcake patterns.
