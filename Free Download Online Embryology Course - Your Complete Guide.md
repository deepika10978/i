*   **Implantation:** The attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall.
*   **Gastrulation:** The formation of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm).
*   **Organogenesis:** The development of the major organ systems from the germ layers.
*   **Fetal Development:** The growth and maturation of the fetus during the later stages of pregnancy.
*   **Congenital Abnormalities:** The causes and mechanisms of birth defects.
*   **Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):** An overview of techniques such as IVF, ICSI, and embryo cryopreservation.
*   **Ethics in Embryology:** Ethical considerations related to ART and genetic manipulation.

## Finding the Right Online Embryology Course

With numerous online embryology courses available, choosing the right one can be challenging. Consider the following factors:

*   **Instructor Credentials:** Look for courses taught by experienced embryologists, reproductive specialists, or developmental biologists. Check their educational background and professional affiliations.
