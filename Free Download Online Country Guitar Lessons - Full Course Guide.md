*   **Hybrid Picking:** This technique combines a pick with your fingers to create a unique sound and allow for complex patterns.
*   **Scales and Licks:** Learning country-specific scales and licks will give you the building blocks for improvisation and soloing. Pentatonic and blues scales are especially useful.
