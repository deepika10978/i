## Getting Started: Essential Materials and Techniques

Before diving into the course, let's outline the fundamental materials and techniques you'll need to understand to begin your journey towards creating stunning pencil portraits:

### Essential Materials

*   **Pencils:** A variety of graphite pencils (2H, HB, 2B, 4B, 6B) are essential. The "H" pencils are harder and create lighter lines, while "B" pencils are softer and create darker lines.
*   **Paper:** Smooth drawing paper or Bristol board is ideal for pencil portraits. Avoid textured paper as it can interfere with fine details.
*   **Erasers:** A kneaded eraser is perfect for lifting graphite without damaging the paper. A precision eraser is useful for making fine corrections.
*   **Blending Stumps/Tortillions:** These tools are used to blend graphite for smooth shading.
*   **Sharpener:** A good quality pencil sharpener that creates a sharp point is crucial.
*   **Ruler:** A ruler is helpful for creating accurate guidelines and proportions.

### Fundamental Techniques

*   **Line Work:** Practice creating a variety of lines, from light and delicate to dark and bold. Focus on controlling the pressure you apply to the pencil.
*   **Shading:** Mastering shading is crucial for creating depth and form in a portrait. Experiment with different shading techniques like hatching, cross-hatching, blending, and stippling.
*   **Proportion and Anatomy:** Understanding basic human anatomy and proportions is essential for creating realistic portraits. Study reference images and learn the key landmarks of the face.
*   **Value:** Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a tone. Learning to accurately represent values is essential for creating realistic form and depth.
*   **Composition:** Consider the placement of the subject within the frame and how different elements interact with each other.
