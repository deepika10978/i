## What to Look For in a Great Online Guitar Course

Before you dive into that free download (hint: it's coming soon!), it's essential to know what distinguishes a good online guitar course from a mediocre one. Here's a checklist of key features:

*   **Beginner-Friendly Curriculum:** The course should start with the absolute basics, assuming you've never held a guitar before. This includes proper posture, holding the pick, and understanding basic music theory concepts.
*   **Structured Learning Path:** A well-structured course progresses logically, building upon previous lessons. Avoid courses that jump around haphazardly or introduce complex techniques too early.
*   **Clear and Concise Instruction:** The instructor should be able to explain concepts clearly and avoid jargon. Visual aids, such as diagrams and tablature, are essential.
*   **Practical Exercises and Drills:** Learning guitar is about more than just theory; it's about building muscle memory and developing technique. The course should include plenty of exercises and drills to help you practice.
*   **Variety of Content:** Look for courses that incorporate different learning styles. This might include video lessons, written materials, audio exercises, and interactive quizzes.
*   **Support and Community:** Having access to support from the instructor or a community of fellow learners can be invaluable. This could be through a forum, a Q&A section, or live group sessions.
*   **Song-Based Learning:** While foundational exercises are important, learning to play actual songs is what keeps you motivated. The course should include lessons on popular songs that are appropriate for your skill level.
*   **Focus on Technique:** Good technique is crucial for avoiding bad habits and preventing injuries. The course should emphasize proper finger placement, strumming patterns, and other essential techniques.
*   **Progress Tracking:** The ability to track your progress and see how far you've come can be highly motivating.
